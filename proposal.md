# Motorcycle (Rev Up)

## Repository
<https://github.com/Nyx1325/FinalProject_LE.git>

## Description
1-2 sentence description of what it will do and how it relevant to media and digital arts.

## Features
- Particle trail
	- Same as we've learn but alter the shape & make it follow the motorcyles by adding the start point on both individualy. Connecting it to the grid layout in order to keep them within a clear path. Also, avoid the dead function to keep the particles in place without fading them or deleting before the end of the game.
- Collision
	- Short explaination of how it will be executed.
- Feature 
	- Short explaination of how it will be executed.

## Challenges
- Add some sort of collision aspect when player hits opposing smoke trail.
- See how to alter the randomization for CPU movement.
- See how to keep the particle trail within the grid patterns to show clear path of both characters

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- Briefly describe what is the ideal outcome?

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- Briefly describe the bare essential for a good working outcome?

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Motorcycle & Background design
  2. Grid layout

- Week 2
  1. Randomize the motion of CPU motorcyle
  2. Particle trails & Collision 

- Week N (Final)
  1. Randomize obstcales
  2. Fix any bugs & Optimize
